<h1>Milestone 4</h1>
<p>
To add additional objects to a group, select the group to be added to and press th
<b>Reopen Group</b> button.  This will cause the group to become active and open.  The
next object will be selected automatically.  After this, successive 'Adds' will add to that
group as normal.  Then 'Close' the group to complete the operation.
</p>

<h1>Known Problems</h1>
<ul>
    <li>When re-opening a group that has itself been transformed, the objects added will 'jump' 
    if the group has been rotated.  This is due to my inability to figure out how to get the 
    difference between the groups rotation and the incoming object.  This was easy to overcome 
    with translation by simply getting the difference from the object's translation to the 
    group, but rotation is locked up in the rotation matrix with all x,y,z components meshed 
    together, I couldn't figure out a good way to get that information out.</li>
