<h1>Controls</h1>
<ul>
<li>W = Walk Forward</li>
<li>S = Walk Backward</li>
<li>A = Strafe Left</li>
<li>D = Strafe Right</li>
<li>R = Reset</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon entering the world, you can walk around with the standard FPS game keyboard 
controls: W, A, S, D.</p>
<p>Holding keys down will continue moving until another movement key is pressed. 
GLUT does not seem to have any method of maintaining key down state, so continuous 
movement with many keys doesn't seem possible.</p>
<p>Right-clicking the mouse and holding allows you to move your head around and aim 
the cross-hairs at the targets.  While right-clicking (or without), a left-click will 
fire the gun, if the gun is pointing at a target that is standing up, it will fall 
down.</p>
<p>Once all targets are knocked down, press 'R' to reset the game and the targets will 
stand up again.</p>
