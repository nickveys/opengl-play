<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>To create a bezier curve, click New Curve and start adding points.  Once there are at least 
3 points the curve will become visible.  Continued clicking adds more points.</p>
<p>To modify a curve, click Modify Points and click-drag points to change the curve.</p>
<p>To create a bezier surface, click New Surface and one will be created.</p>
<p>To rotate the view, click Camera Model and click-drag to change the view on the 
curve/surface.</p>
<p>To change U, slide the U spinner from 0 to 1.</p>

<h1>Known Issues</h1>
<ul>
<li>Manual creation of surfaces is not implemented.  One has its control points statically 
defined.</li>
<li>Shaded surfaces are not implemented.  The quad strip is complete, but no normals are 
specified.</li>
<li>Camera rotation is off-axis.  I was unable to see why exactly, as it is a direct use of 
the camera class as before.</li>
<li>Surfaces are not modifyable.</li>
</ul>
